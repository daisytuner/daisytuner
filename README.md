# Transfer Tuning

This repository implements the [similarity-based transfer tuning algorithm](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3577193.3593714), which fuzzy matches loop transformations from online databases using *performance embeddings*.
Additionally, the package provides several utils for benchmarking and optimizing SDFGs.

Installation is as simple as

```bash
# Dependencies
conda install isl nlohmann_json
# Install
pip install daisytuner
```
